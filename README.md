# Noah's Ark
Noah's Ark is a Semi-Untethered Jailbreak for iOS 15.0 - 15.4.1 (15.5b1-4, 15.6b1-4) 
This Jailbreak supports all devices on A12 - A15.

Hopefully, if I obtain a large enough team, I will continue to update it. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Disclaimer:
I (Noah) am the only one who offers support for this jailbreak at the moment.
I am just using other tools from other devs. The updates to the exploit are my doing.
FOR NOW, IPADS ARE NOT SUPPORTED.

Massive thanks to Linus Henze for making this wonderful exploit & making it usable for a jailbreak.
Noah's Ark will be released before May 29th. :)

Another massive thanks to: Lars Froder for other tools as well. He is an amazing dev.
Be sure to check out his twitter or follow him sometime.
